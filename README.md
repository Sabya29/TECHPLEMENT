This is a website that displays a "Quote of the Day" when a user logs in, it allows user the functionality to search for quotes with "author name". I have named the website "DailyQuotient", it has a functional registration system that allows new users to register with it. I have used PHP as the primary language with HTML to give structure and CSS .
